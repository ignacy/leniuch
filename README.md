== DEPRECATED

This is the first Rails application I did "on the job", the first commit is from [September 2008](https://github.com/ignacy/leniuch/commit/ffe46db9450e88f630f51ac4177203b2a097764c) I belive the Rails version was 1.2.3 at the time.

I keep this project arround as a fun reminder but please keep in mind that this is not how you should write your code ;)
